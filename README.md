# Snake Game

## Game Objective:
Challenge yourself in this good old-fashioned Snake game and try to get the highest score you can by eating the Food appearing on the screen.

## Game Rules & Mechanics:
Eating Food will award you with 1 point and enlarge the Snake by one.
Upon eating a Food object, a new one shall appear on a different spot of the game screen.

Upon bumping the Snake's head into a wall or its body - the game will be over.

Use "Up", "Down", "Left", "Right" arrows to move the Snake around (Trying to move the Snake's head into its opposite direction is forbidden
and will have any effect), press on "p" if you wish to pause the game.

Scoreboard will always appear in the top area of the game screen, showing current score and highest score achieved so far.
