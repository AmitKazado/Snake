# Snake Game

Good old-fashioned snake game, move the snake towards the food on the screen, each food object eaten enlarges the snake's
size by 1 and enhances the difficulty.

## Game Objective:
Challenge yourself to get the highest score you can! each time you eat a food object (a blue circle) you get 1 point added to your score.
In case of hitting the wall or bumping the snake's head into his body - your game will be over.
