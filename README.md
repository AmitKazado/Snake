# Snake Game

Good old-fashioned snake game, move the snake and eat the fruits on the screen, each fruit eaten enlarges the snake's
size by 1 and enhances the difficulty.
This project was made during my free time as a part of my python self-learning experience.

Game Objective:
Try to get the highest score you can, each time you eat a food object (a blue circle) you get 1 point added to your score.
in case of hitting the wall or bumping the snake's head into his body - your game will be over.

Python version: 3.10.7
